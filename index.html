	<p>To capture pictures is to capture a memory. I use photos and images to tell myself a story on what happened on a specific day or a specific time.</p>
	<p>Almost to help myself relive it. It provides a comforting sense of a time where I was happy or excited. In the images I’ll share, there will always be a story behind it,</p>
	<p>in which I was the happiest. These pictures are emotionally significant in my life. Sontag does point out how taking pictures does strip away from the experience itself, like “not living in the moment,”</p>
	<p>how images are captured and taken, but aren’t lived. Although I do agree with the statement, the images afterwards help me replay the experience over and over again. I get the feeling of reminiscing and the same feeling of being there again.</p>
	<p>With the 9 projects, we can see the continuous joy of having company. Using new tools with each project, we can still come to the same conclusion.</p>
	<p>everyone perceives an image differently. However, with the images I intend to take now reading Sontag’s writing, I want to capture a quiet and peaceful setting to determine societal values.</p>
	<p>Not only do I want my photos to showcase the memories and experiences I’ve had, I also want them to notice dynamics or the emotions portrayed in the</p>
	<p>images. Sontag does state how photos do freeze the experience, but the words explaining it might contradict people’s point of view. Photography is a beautiful way of peeking</p>
	<p>into someone else’s mind and how they perceive the world.</p>
